# PicHub
Pichub was my personal project for the subject IISSI2 in my second University Year.

## Used technology
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
   - Bootstrap
 - JavaScript
   - JQuery
   - AJAX
 - JTinder library
 - Json-server

## Tasks
The file `to-do.html` is a list of to-do and already-done tasks in HTML format. I generate it automatically from `to-do.org` making use of Emacs' `org-mode`.

## Deploying the backend
The script `JSON-server.bat` automatically launches json-server with the user authentication configuration established by the project's manager.
